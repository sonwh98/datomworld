In Datom.world, because the structure is fixed and minimal, random modification can produce viable offspring. The stream of Datoms becomes a genetic lineage where mutations flow forward, and because history is preserved (immutable), \"bad mutations\" do not destroy the organism. The system can rewind and branch off a new timeline."]
