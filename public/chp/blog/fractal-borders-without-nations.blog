          [:h2 "The Thought Experiment"]

          [:p "Imagine a world without national borders. No passports, no visas, no immigration controls. People and capital flow freely across the entire planet. What would happen?"]

          [:p "The naive assumption is that everything would homogenize. Wages would equalize. Cities would become interchangeable. Economic activity would spread uniformly across the globe."]

          [:p [:strong "This is the same mistaken assumption that classical thermodynamics makes"] ": that systems naturally tend toward equilibrium and uniformity. " [:strong "It's wrong in physics, and it's wrong in economics"] ". Classical thermodynamics assumes closed systems moving toward heat death, maximum entropy, uniform temperature. But " [:strong "real systems are open"] ". They have energy flowing through them. And when you have flow through an open system, you don't get homogenization. " [:strong "You get structure"] "."]

          [:p "A river doesn't spread uniformly across the landscape. It creates channels, eddies, deltas. A living organism doesn't distribute resources evenly. It creates specialized organs. " [:strong "Flow creates differentiation, not uniformity"] ". The second law of thermodynamics doesn't prohibit structure; it " [:em "requires"] " structure formation in open systems as the mechanism by which entropy increases globally while order emerges locally."]

          [:p "This is exactly what happens in software systems, as explored in " [:a {:href "/blog/code-entropy-evolution.blog"} "Code, Entropy, and Evolution"] ". A codebase doesn't remain a uniform blob. It " [:strong "naturally modularizes"] ". Modules form with clear boundaries, connected to other modules through narrow, well-defined interfaces. " [:strong "Loose coupling between modules, tight cohesion within modules"] ". The module boundaries are the software equivalent of borders: they control what flows in and out, they encapsulate complexity, they enable independent evolution."]

          [:p "Economic geography works the same way. In a borderless world with free flow of people, capital, and goods, you wouldn't get homogenization. " [:strong "You'd get structure formation: economic modules (clusters) connected by well-defined interfaces (transportation networks)"] ". " [:strong "Borders would immediately re-emerge"] ", not political borders enforced by laws and guns, but " [:strong "economic borders defined by cost gradients"] ". These borders would be just as real, just as impermeable for most people, and far more interesting in their structure. Like software modules, economic clusters would exhibit " [:strong "loose coupling to other clusters but tight cohesion within themselves"] "."]

          [:h2 "Cost Creates Boundaries"]

          [:p "In a borderless world, economic geography organizes itself according to a simple principle: " [:strong "cost of living creates natural barriers"] ". A software engineer earning $200,000 in San Francisco can't afford to live there on $50,000. The rent, the food prices, the cost of childcare,all of it forms an invisible wall as effective as any physical barrier."]

          [:p "This creates a fascinating emergent structure. High-cost regions become " [:strong "economic organs"] ",specialized zones where only certain activities can justify the expense of operating there. Just as your brain is expensive tissue that only handles tasks requiring maximum computation, high-cost cities become centers for activities generating enough value to cover their overhead."]

          [:p "Surrounding these high-cost centers are concentric rings of progressively cheaper regions, each hosting activities appropriate to their cost structure. " [:strong "The gradient itself becomes the border"] ". You don't need a fence when the price of housing is the fence."]

          [:h2 "The Fractal Structure of Economic Geography"]

          [:p "In the " [:a {:href "/blog/all-money-is-monopoly-money.blog"} "previous blog"] ", we explored how expertise forms a " [:strong "fractal learning curve"] ". Mastering one level reveals new depths beneath it, branching infinitely at every scale. Economic geography without political borders would follow the same fractal pattern."]

          [:p "Here's the crucial insight: " [:strong "national borders are what create \"global\" innovation clusters concentrated in a few privileged nations"] ". Today's reality, Silicon Valley for tech, Boston for biotech, London for finance, is " [:strong "not the natural fractal distribution"] ". It's an artifact of political borders that trap talent and capital within certain countries while excluding it from others."]

          [:p [:strong "Without national borders, innovation would fractally distribute everywhere"] ". You wouldn't have a handful of innovation centers in wealthy nations. Instead, " [:strong "innovation clusters would emerge at every scale, in every region, specialized by domain and local context"] ". A village in India might become a cluster for textile manufacturing innovation. A city in Nigeria for agricultural technology. A region in Brazil for rainforest ecology and biotech. These clusters would form " [:strong "because talented people everywhere could access the resources, capital, and collaborators they need"] ", not because they won the lottery of being born in the right country."]

          [:p "The current system is " [:strong "detrimental to human development precisely because political borders prevent this natural fractal emergence"] ". Talented people in poor countries can't access capital, can't collaborate with researchers in rich countries, can't even move to where the opportunities exist. Their potential withers. The fractal learning curve is available to Americans and Europeans but inaccessible to billions of others, not because they lack ability, but because " [:strong "political borders artificially concentrate resources and opportunity in a few geographic locations"] "."]

          [:p "In a borderless world, each local innovation cluster would have its own nested structure. Surrounding a textile innovation village: zones of advanced weaving, dyeing facilities, materials testing. Surrounding an agricultural tech city: experimental farms, seed development, distribution networks. " [:strong "Each cluster naturally develops the full fractal tree appropriate to its domain"] ". The pattern repeats at every scale, but crucially, " [:strong "it repeats everywhere, not just in wealthy nations"] "."]

          [:p "And the pattern " [:strong "repeats at every scale"] ". Within each high-cost innovation cluster itself, you'd find expensive neighborhoods for executives and successful founders, surrounded by cheaper areas for junior engineers and service workers. Within each neighborhood, the same pattern: expensive blocks and cheaper blocks. " [:strong "Fractals all the way down"] ". The self-similar structure emerges naturally from economic physics, not political planning. No global center, just " [:strong "self-similar clustering patterns repeating at every level of magnification"] "."]

          [:h2 "Transportation Networks as the Bloodstream"]

          [:p "In a biological organism, specialized organs can only exist because they're connected by transportation networks. Your brain consumes 20% of your energy despite being 2% of your body mass. It can only afford this extravagance because the bloodstream delivers glucose and oxygen while removing waste. The nervous system coordinates signals across the entire organism."]

          [:p "Economic geography works the same way. High-cost innovation centers can only survive if they're connected to lower-cost production zones by " [:strong "efficient transportation networks"] ". These networks are the economic bloodstream:"]

          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "Physical logistics"] ": shipping goods from manufacturing zones to consumption centers"]
           [:li [:strong "Digital infrastructure"] ": fiber optic cables transmitting designs, code, and coordination signals"]
           [:li [:strong "Financial flows"] ": capital moving from high-return innovation zones to fund expansion in production zones"]
           [:li [:strong "Human migration"] ": talent flowing toward opportunity, remittances flowing back to family"]]

          [:p "The quality and efficiency of these networks determine the viable structure of the economic organism. " [:strong "Better transportation collapses distance"] ", allowing greater specialization. A slow, expensive logistics network forces regions to be more self-sufficient. A fast, cheap one enables extreme specialization and interdependence."]

          [:p "This is why infrastructure is never just about moving things. " [:strong "It's about enabling the organizational structure of the economy itself"] ". When you build a high-speed rail line or lay a fiber optic cable, you're not just connecting two points. You're allowing new patterns of specialization to emerge, new organs to form, new levels of the fractal to develop."]

          [:h2 "Why Organs Form: The Economics of Agglomeration"]

          [:p "But why do these economic organs form in the first place? Why doesn't economic activity spread uniformly?"]

          [:p "The answer is " [:strong "agglomeration effects"] ", the benefits that come from clustering similar activities together. " [:strong "This is the same design principle as high cohesion in software architecture"] ". Just as a well-designed software module groups related functions together to minimize dependencies and maximize internal cooperation, economic clusters group related activities together for the same reasons."]

          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "Knowledge spillovers"] ": Engineers learn from other engineers at lunch. Researchers collaborate spontaneously. Tacit knowledge spreads through proximity. (High cohesion: related knowledge stays within the cluster)"]
           [:li [:strong "Specialized labor pools"] ": If you're a machine learning researcher, you move to where other ML researchers are. Employers move there too. The cluster reinforces itself. (High cohesion: related expertise concentrates)"]
           [:li [:strong "Supplier ecosystems"] ": When many companies need the same specialized services, suppliers emerge to serve them. This only works at scale. (High cohesion: related services colocate)"]
           [:li [:strong "Infrastructure sharing"] ": Expensive facilities (accelerators, clean rooms, testing equipment) only make sense when shared across many users. (High cohesion: shared resources within the module)"]]

          [:p "And just as well-designed modules maintain " [:strong "loose coupling"] " to other modules through narrow, well-defined interfaces, economic clusters maintain loose coupling to other clusters through transportation networks (the interfaces). " [:strong "High cohesion within clusters, loose coupling between clusters"] ". The same principle that makes software maintainable makes economies resilient. As explored in " [:a {:href "/blog/code-entropy-evolution.blog"} "Code, Entropy, and Evolution"] ", this isn't coincidence. It's the same fundamental pattern of structure formation in open systems."]

          [:p "These effects create " [:strong "positive feedback loops"] ". Success attracts talent, which attracts capital, which funds more success. The cluster grows. Costs rise. But as long as the value created exceeds the cost, the organ continues to thrive."]

          [:p "In dynamical systems theory, this is called a " [:strong "strange attractor"] ",a region in phase space toward which a system naturally evolves and around which it orbits, despite perturbations. High-cost innovation centers act as strange attractors in economic geography. Talented people are drawn toward them, not by force or law, but by the " [:strong "gravitational pull of opportunity"] ". Once there, they orbit in the ecosystem: moving between companies, starting ventures, collaborating, even if they occasionally leave and return. The attractor maintains its pull."]

          [:p "But here's what makes it " [:em "strange"] ": " [:strong "the attractor's strength is self-reinforcing but also self-limiting"] ". As more talent flows in, the region becomes more valuable (stronger attraction), but costs also rise (weaker accessibility). The system never reaches equilibrium,it oscillates, with talent flowing in during booms and flowing out during busts, but the strange attractor persists. Silicon Valley, New York finance, London's financial district,these aren't just places. They're " [:strong "stable patterns in the flow of economic activity"] ", attractors that persist across decades despite constant churn of individuals and companies."]

          [:p "Eventually, costs rise enough that certain activities get priced out. They migrate to the next ring, where costs are lower. " [:strong "The organ develops a specialized function and sheds activities that don't justify the overhead"] ". This is exactly how biological organs develop during embryonic growth,cells specialize by location, shedding functions they can delegate to cheaper tissues elsewhere. The strange attractor doesn't capture everything,it " [:strong "filters for activities that can justify its gravitational cost"] "."]

          [:h2 "Borders Without Immigration Laws"]

          [:p "Here's the crucial insight: " [:strong "these economic borders are just as real as political ones, but they operate through cost rather than law"] "."]

          [:p "In today's world, a person from a poor country who wants to move to San Francisco faces two barriers:"]

          [:ol
           [:li [:strong "Legal barrier"] ": visa restrictions, immigration quotas, citizenship requirements"]
           [:li [:strong "Economic barrier"] ": even if you can get there legally, can you afford $3,000/month rent?"]]

          [:p "We focus on the legal barrier because it's explicit and feels unjust. But in a borderless world, " [:strong "the economic barrier alone would be just as effective for most people"] "."]

          [:p "The difference is that economic borders have " [:strong "permeability based on value creation"] ". If you can command a high enough salary (by possessing rare skills, creating valuable companies, or providing services the high-cost region needs), you can cross the border. The barrier isn't absolute,it's gradient-based."]

          [:p "This creates a fundamentally different dynamic than political borders:"]

          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "Meritocratic permeability"] ": Anyone who can create enough value can enter, regardless of birthplace"]
           [:li [:strong "Automatic adjustment"] ": If too few people can afford to live in a region, costs fall or the region shrinks"]
           [:li [:strong "Economic signaling"] ": High costs signal that an activity creates enough value to justify them"]
           [:li [:strong "No artificial scarcity"] ": Political borders create arbitrary winners and losers by lottery of birth. Economic borders respond to actual productivity."]]

          [:p "Of course, this still creates inequality. Being born in a low-cost region with poor educational infrastructure means you're far less likely to develop the skills needed to cross into high-cost regions. " [:strong "The border is permeable in theory but often impermeable in practice"] ". But the mechanism is fundamentally different: it's about whether you can create value that justifies the cost, not about whether your passport has the right stamp."]

          [:h2 "The Fractal Learning Curve and Geographic Mobility"]

          [:p "Remember the " [:strong "fractal learning curve"] " from the " [:a {:href "/blog/all-money-is-monopoly-money.blog"} "previous blog"] ": learning in any complex domain reveals infinite depths at every level. Each mastery opens new branches of specialization. This connects directly to economic geography."]

          [:p "In a borderless world organized by cost gradients, " [:strong "your physical location tracks your position on the fractal learning curve"] ". As you climb the curve in your domain,machinist to advanced machinist to process engineer to manufacturing systems designer,you can justify living in progressively more expensive regions where that expertise commands higher value."]

          [:p "But here's the critical insight: " [:strong "you can only climb the fractal learning curve by doing the work"] ". And " [:strong "you can only do the work if the work exists where you are"] "."]

          [:p "This creates a " [:strong "poverty trap through geographic isolation from learning opportunities"] ". If you're born in a region where only basic manufacturing exists, you can learn basic manufacturing skills. But without access to advanced manufacturing, you can't climb to the next level of the curve. You're stuck not because you lack ability, but because " [:strong "the fractal structure doesn't exist in your location"] "."]

          [:p "In today's world, political borders often trap people in this way. In a borderless world, " [:strong "economic borders would trap people through the same mechanism but for different reasons"] ". You'd be free to move anywhere, but you couldn't afford to move to where the learning opportunities exist."]

          [:h2 "The Transportation Network as Social Equalizer"]

          [:p "This is why the transportation network matters so much. It's not just about moving goods,it's about " [:strong "enabling people to access learning opportunities without relocating"] "."]

          [:p "If high-speed rail lets you live in a low-cost region but work in a high-cost innovation center, you can climb the fractal learning curve while maintaining affordable living costs. " [:strong "The transportation network breaks the tyranny of geography"] "."]

          [:p "Similarly, digital infrastructure enables remote work, remote learning, and remote participation in high-value activities. A talented programmer in a low-cost region can contribute to cutting-edge projects through fiber optic cables. " [:strong "Bandwidth becomes a substitute for physical proximity"] "."]

          [:p "But,and this is crucial, " [:strong "digital infrastructure can't replace everything"] ". As we explored in the previous blog, tacit knowledge spreads through physical proximity. The random hallway conversation, the impromptu whiteboard session, the coffee chat that leads to breakthrough insights. " [:strong "Innovation still requires density"] ". The bloodstream of digital communication can distribute certain types of work, but it can't fully replicate the agglomeration effects of physical clustering."]

          [:h2 "Currency and Cost Gradients"]

          [:p "One fascinating question: in a world without political borders, " [:strong "would we still have multiple currencies"] "?"]

          [:p "You might think a single global currency would emerge. And in some sense it would,probably a handful of dominant currencies used for international trade and financial transactions, much like the dollar today."]

          [:p "But " [:strong "local currencies would likely persist or even proliferate"] ". Why? Because currency is a tool for " [:strong "managing local cost gradients"] "."]

          [:p "A high-cost region experiencing an influx of capital (a tech boom, for instance) would see its local currency appreciate. This makes imports cheaper (good for residents) but also makes the region more expensive for outsiders (preserving the cost gradient that defines its borders). A low-cost region would have a weaker currency, making it attractive for manufacturing and cost-sensitive operations."]

          [:p [:strong "Currency becomes the mechanism by which cost borders self-regulate"] ". When too many people try to move into a high-cost region, the currency strengthens, costs rise, and the border reasserts itself. When people leave, the currency weakens, costs fall, and the region becomes accessible again."]

          [:p "This is exactly how the " [:a {:href "/blog/all-money-is-monopoly-money.blog"} "flow dynamics of money"] " work: currency isn't wealth itself, but a coordination mechanism. In a borderless world, " [:strong "currency would coordinate economic geography"] ", allowing regions to specialize and develop distinct cost structures appropriate to their function in the larger economic organism."]

          [:h2 "What Political Borders Actually Do"]

          [:p "This thought experiment reveals what political borders actually accomplish. They don't create the " [:em "existence"] " of economic differentiation,that would emerge naturally from cost gradients. Instead, they " [:strong "override and distort the natural cost structure"] "."]

          [:p "Political borders do three things:"]

          [:ol
           [:li [:strong "Artificial scarcity"] ": They prevent people from moving to where they could be most productive, creating winners (those born on the right side) and losers (those born on the wrong side)"]
           [:li [:strong "Local monopoly"] ": They allow governments to extract rents from their captive populations through taxation, regulation, and monetary policy"]
           [:li [:strong "Coordination at scale"] ": They enable large-scale collective action (infrastructure, defense, legal systems) that would be hard to organize through pure market mechanisms"]]

          [:p "The first two are costs. The third is a genuine benefit. " [:strong "The question is whether we can get the coordination benefits without the artificial scarcity and rent extraction"] "."]

          [:h2 "The Biological Analogy Completes"]

          [:p "Let's return to the biological organism. Your body has specialized organs connected by bloodstream and nervous system. But it also has " [:strong "regulatory systems"] ": hormones that coordinate behavior across organs, immune responses that protect the whole organism, homeostatic mechanisms that maintain balance."]

          [:p "In economic geography, what plays these regulatory roles?"]

          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "Markets"] ": Price signals coordinate activity across regions, directing resources where they're most valued"]
           [:li [:strong "Financial systems"] ": Capital flows from regions with surplus to regions with opportunities"]
           [:li [:strong "Legal frameworks"] ": Property rights, contracts, dispute resolution enable trust at distance"]
           [:li [:strong "Cultural norms"] ": Shared languages, values, and expectations reduce transaction costs"]]

          [:p "In today's world, " [:strong "political borders provide these regulatory functions within nations but obstruct them across nations"] ". A borderless world would need to develop global regulatory systems,not global government necessarily, but " [:strong "coordination mechanisms that work at planetary scale"] "."]

          [:p "This is the hardest part. Markets can coordinate production and consumption. Financial systems can move capital. But legal frameworks and cultural norms require " [:strong "trust"] ", and trust is difficult to build at global scale without some form of shared governance."]

          [:h2 "Conclusion: Borders Are Necessary, Not Bad"]

          [:p "The central insight: " [:strong "borders are not artifacts of political choice. They're emergent properties of economic physics"] ". Even in a world without nations, borders would form,defined by cost gradients, maintained by economic reality, organized in fractal patterns of specialization."]

          [:p "More fundamentally, " [:strong "borders are not bad. Borders are necessary for computation and value creation"] ". As explored in " [:a {:href "/blog/maxwells-demon-economic-value.blog"} "Maxwell's Demon and Economic Value"] ", value creation requires selective filtering. A Maxwell's demon creates value by maintaining a boundary and selectively allowing particles through based on their properties. An interpreter creates value by maintaining context boundaries and translating between them. " [:strong "Without borders, there can be no Maxwell's demons, no interpreters, no value creation through selective filtering and context management"] ". Borders enable computation itself."]

          [:p "The difference between political borders and economic borders is " [:strong "permeability and mechanism"] ":"]

          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "Political borders"] ": Enforced by law, crossed by lottery of birth or political favor, fundamentally arbitrary"]
           [:li [:strong "Economic borders"] ": Enforced by cost, crossed by value creation, responsive to actual productivity"]]

          [:p "Neither system is perfectly just. Economic borders still concentrate opportunity in certain regions and make it nearly impossible for those born in poor areas to access the fractal learning opportunities that would let them escape. But the " [:strong "mechanism of exclusion is fundamentally different"] "."]

          [:p "Political borders say: " [:em "\"You cannot enter because you were born on the wrong side.\""] " Economic borders say: " [:em "\"You cannot afford to enter unless you create enough value to justify the cost.\""] " The latter is at least theoretically permeable to talent and effort."]

          [:p "The real question is: " [:strong "can we build the transportation networks,physical, digital, financial, educational,that break the tyranny of geographic poverty traps"] "? Can we enable people born in low-cost regions to access the learning opportunities concentrated in high-cost centers, without requiring them to physically relocate?"]

          [:p "If we can, then economic borders become " [:strong "gradients to climb rather than walls to break"] ". The fractal structure of specialization can develop naturally, organs can form where they're most efficient, and the transportation networks can distribute opportunity more equitably than political borders ever have."]

          [:p "And if we can't, then we've simply replaced visible political walls with invisible economic ones,equally effective, arguably more insidious, because they masquerade as meritocracy while preserving the same arbitrary inequalities of birth."]

          [:p "The choice is ours. The borders are inevitable. But their nature,and our response to them,is not."]

          [:h2 "Datomworld: A Prediction"]

          [:p "This is not purely theoretical. " [:strong "I predict Datomworld will create fractal borders with organs forming like strange attractors, connected by streams of datoms"] ". But Datomworld is a " [:strong "digital system operating in abstract space"] ", not physical geography. The geographic metaphor illuminates the pattern, but the actual implementation transcends physical location entirely."]

          [:p "Datomworld doesn't pretend borders won't form. Instead, it " [:strong "accepts that abstract spaces will organize themselves into organ-like clusters"] ", each specializing in activities appropriate to their position in the relevance network. What Datomworld provides is the " [:strong "transportation infrastructure"] ",the bloodstream and nervous system,that connects these clusters and enables them to function as a coherent organism. But these clusters exist in " [:strong "abstract geometric space defined by data relationships, attention flows, and capability networks"] ", not physical cities or regions."]

          [:p "The key components:"]

          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "DaoDB"] ": An organ that indexes datoms for queryability with Datalog.

           [:li [:strong "DaoStream"] ": The digital nervous system. Flow-based architecture that models economic activity as streams of datoms moving through networks. Resources and signals flow where they're needed, driven by gradients rather than central planning."]
           [:li [:strong "ShiBi"] ": A " [:a {:href "/blog/shibi-as-money.blog"} "system for creating capability tokens"] " that grant access based on relevance and contribution rather than purchasing power. ShiBi deliberately tries not to be money, instead creating context-specific tokens that establish borders based on expertise and value created."]]

          [:p "In practice, this means " [:strong "Datomworld participants will naturally form clusters in abstract space"] ",not because of laws or restrictions, but because agglomeration effects make certain positions in the network more valuable for certain activities. A cluster of AI researchers might form in one abstract space, creating a strange attractor that pulls in related talent. A manufacturing coordination hub might emerge in a different region of abstract space, connected to the research cluster through Datomworld's transportation infrastructure of datom streams."]

          [:p [:strong "The critical difference from today's system: the borders between these clusters are permeable economic gradients, not impermeable political walls"] ". Someone in a low-cost manufacturing cluster can contribute to high-value research projects through the digital nervous system (DaoStream), with coordination enabled by querying the indexed datoms (DaoDB). Capital can flow from high-return clusters to fund expansion in production clusters through the economic bloodstream (DaoStream). And capability tokens (ShiBi) grant access based on relevance and contribution, not just economic position."]

          [:p "But ShiBi introduces something even more interesting: " [:strong "capability tokens that create borders based on relevance rather than economics"] ". Traditional economic borders ask: " [:em "\"Can you afford to be here?\""] " ShiBi's capability tokens ask: " [:em "\"Are you relevant to this context?\""] " This creates a fundamentally different kind of boundary."]

          [:p "A capability token grants access not because you're wealthy, but because you possess specific skills, knowledge, or relationships that matter to a particular cluster. " [:strong "The border is contextual and dynamic"] ". You might have high access to an AI research cluster because you contribute valuable insights, while having no access to a manufacturing cluster where you lack relevant expertise,regardless of your economic status. Conversely, a skilled machinist might have deep access to manufacturing contexts that an AI researcher cannot enter, even if the researcher is wealthier."]

          [:p "This creates " [:strong "fractal borders within borders in abstract space"] ". Attention and computational cost gradients determine which regions of the abstract network you can access. Within those regions, capability tokens determine which " [:em "contexts"] " you can participate in. A person in a low-attention region of the network might have extremely high capability tokens in certain specialized domains, granting them influence and access far beyond what their network position would suggest. " [:strong "Relevance, not just wealth or attention, becomes the key that unlocks doors"] "."]

          [:p "The result is a " [:strong "multidimensional border structure in abstract space"] ". Network position gradients create clusters in the abstract geometry. Capability tokens create contextual access within and across those clusters. You navigate both simultaneously. This is far more sophisticated than either political borders (which only care where you were born) or pure economic borders (which only care what you can afford). " [:strong "Datomworld's borders ask: where are you in the network, what can you contribute, and what contexts are you relevant to?"] ""]

          [:p "The physical geography metaphor illuminates the pattern: " [:strong "just as physical organs form in bodies, abstract organs form in Datomworld's network space"] ". But Datomworld transcends physical location. A farmer in rural India and a researcher in Boston can occupy adjacent positions in Datomworld's abstract space if they're working on related agricultural technology problems. Their physical distance is irrelevant. What matters is their position in the " [:strong "abstract geometry of relevance, capability, and contribution"] ". The organs form naturally in this abstract space. The bloodstream and nervous system are deliberately designed as digital infrastructure. And the capability token system ensures that " [:strong "access is granted based on contribution and relevance, not just purchasing power or physical location"] "."]

          [:p "The result: a global economic organism that " [:strong "exists in abstract digital space, transcending both national borders and physical geography entirely"] ". The fractal learning curve remains accessible because the digital transportation infrastructure connects all levels of the structure, regardless of physical location.
