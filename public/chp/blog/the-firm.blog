          [:p "In 1937, Ronald Coase asked a simple question: If markets are so efficient, why do companies exist?"]
          [:p "His answer, which won him a Nobel Prize, was " [:strong "transaction costs"] ". It costs time and money to find the right person, negotiate a price, enforce a contract, and coordinate work. When these costs are high, it makes sense to bring everything under one roof, creating a 'Firm' with managers and employees."]
          [:p "But look closer: every transaction cost is, at root, an " [:strong "information cost"] ". Finding a partner is information. Verifying their quality is information. Enforcing a contract requires information about performance. Even money itself is an information system: a protocol for encoding and transmitting value signals. Human society (markets, firms, governments) is fundamentally a system for sharing information under constraints."]
          [:p "What happens when those constraints disappear?"]

          [:h2 "Why Markets Fail (and Firms Succeed)"]
          [:p "Before we dissolve the firm, we must understand why it exists. In theory, markets are efficient coordination machines. The price mechanism signals scarcity and demand instantly. But in practice, markets fail for complex tasks due to four specific frictions:"]
          [:h3 "1. Search and Information Costs"]
          [:p "In a pure market, you'd have to wake up and 'hire' a toothbrushing service, 'negotiate' a breakfast provider, and 'contract' a driver every single day. Finding the right partner and price for every action is prohibitively expensive."]
          [:h3 "2. The Holdup Problem (Asset Specificity)"]
          [:p "Markets fail when you invest in a specific asset (like a machine die) that is only useful for one partner. That partner can then 'hold you up,' demanding higher prices because you have no alternative. Firms solve this by vertical integration: buying the partner so you are on the same team."]
          [:h3 "3. Incomplete Contracts (Uncertainty)"]
          [:p "You can't write a contract for every possible future event. If you hire a contractor for 'Project A' and the market shifts to 'Project B,' renegotiating is costly and adversarial. Firms solve this with employment contracts, which use " [:strong "fiat"] " (authority) to simply say 'Stop A, start B' without negotiation."]
          [:h3 "4. Trust and Verification Costs"]
          [:p "How do you know the other party will deliver? In anonymous markets, you can't. Verification is expensive: lawyers, escrow, reputation research. Firms solve this by creating long-term relationships where cheating has consequences. You don't steal from your employer because you'll lose future wages."]
          [:p "The Firm is essentially a local island of central planning in a sea of market chaos."]
          [:p "This explains the firm's boundary: " [:strong "outsource when the market can do it better; internalize when transaction costs make the market too expensive"] ". A company doesn't manufacture its own pencils; the market provides them cheaply. But it doesn't outsource core strategy to freelancers, because the information costs would be ruinous. The firm expands until the cost of one more internal transaction equals the cost of doing it on the market."]

          [:h2 "The Coasean Floor"]
          [:p "Think of transaction costs as a floor. Above this floor, you have the open market. Below it, you have the firm."]
          [:p "Historically, the cost of 'contracting out' has been high. You can't hire a freelancer for a 5-minute task because the overhead of finding them, vetting them, and paying them costs more than the task itself. So, you hire an employee to sit at a desk for 8 hours, ready to do whatever comes up."]
          [:p "The internet lowered this floor (e.g., Upwork, Uber), but it didn't remove it. You still have platform fees, payment friction, and trust issues."]

          [:h2 "The Liquefaction of the Firm"]
          [:p "Enter the " [:a {:href "/blog/agents.blog"} "Agent Web"] ". When we combine three technologies, the floor collapses entirely:"]
          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li [:strong "Autonomous Agents: "] "Software that can negotiate, execute, and verify work without human intervention."]
           [:li [:strong "ShiBi Utility Tokens: "] "A friction-free way to compensate agents for specific capabilities and resources."]
           [:li [:strong "DaoDB Trust: "] "A verifiable, immutable record of reputation and capability that removes the need for expensive vetting."]]
          [:p "In this world, the cost of finding and paying an agent (human or AI) to do a specific task drops to milliseconds and negligible utility costs. The boundary of the firm collapses inward."]
          [:p "Remember: outsource when the market can do it better, internalize when transaction costs are too high. When transaction costs approach zero, " [:em "almost everything"] " can be outsourced. Firms can now contract out even granular data processing or AI tasks to a distributed network of user-owned devices. Asset specificity risks decline. The \"Make or Buy\" decision shifts decisively toward \"Buy.\" Or rather: \"Stream.\""]
          [:p "But transaction costs aren't the whole story. Even if I could outsource toothbrushing for free, I might still do it myself: because I'm better at it (comparative advantage), because coordinating with another agent has overhead (coordination costs), or simply because I " [:em "prefer"] " to do it myself (agency). Independence has intrinsic value. The question shifts from \"what's cheapest?\" to \"what do I " [:em "want"] " to do versus delegate?\" This is not a bug. It's the point. The goal is not maximum outsourcing, but maximum choice."]

          [:h2 "The Flash Firm and Fluid Ecosystems"]
          [:p "Instead of static corporations, we will see the rise of 'Flash Firms': ephemeral organizations that assemble instantly for a specific purpose and dissolve just as quickly."]
          [:p "This is possible because of " [:strong "stigmergy"] ", a form of indirect coordination used by social insects. Ants don't have managers. They leave pheromone traces in the environment, and other ants respond to those traces. No central plan, no explicit communication between individuals. Just information embedded in a shared medium."]
          [:p "The insight is profound: " [:em "coordination is information sharing, and the medium matters more than the message"] ". Firms exist because humans lacked a good shared medium. Memos get lost. Meetings are expensive. Knowledge lives in heads and leaves when people do. So we built hierarchies to route information through designated channels: managers, reports, org charts."]
          [:p "But what if the medium itself could coordinate? In a stigmergic firm, there is no central manager issuing orders. Instead, agents leave traces (datoms) in the environment (" [:a {:href "/dao-stream.chp"} "DaoStream"] "), which stimulate subsequent actions by other agents. Coordination emerges from the data itself."]
          [:p "Imagine a software project managed via stigmergy:"]
          [:ul.bulleted
           [:li "A 'Architect Agent' defines the spec and places tasks into the stream."]
           [:li "These tasks act as pheromone trails, attracting specialized coding agents (and human supervisors) to bid on them."]
           [:li "Work is verified automatically via test suites (agents running in " [:a {:href "/yin.chp"} "yin.vm"] "), leaving a 'verification trace'."]
           [:li "Compensation is streamed instantly in ShiBi upon verification."]
           [:li "The 'Firm' exists only as long as the project takes to build."]]
          [:p "But if firms dissolve into streams, what happens to their most guarded asset: data?"]

          [:h2 "Data Sovereignty: The Resource-Based View"]
          [:p "Firms hoard data. That's their moat. In the Theory of the Firm, companies thrive by controlling unique resources, specifically data and knowledge. Datom.world inverts this. Our local-first model gives users (and employees) custody over their own data in " [:a {:href "/dao-db.chp"} "DaoDB"] ", preventing firms from monopolizing it."]
          [:p "This forces a shift to \"invitation-based\" data sharing. Employees or partners contribute streams voluntarily, creating a transparent transaction log that reduces agency problems. While this creates challenges for enforcing traditional IP moats, it enables secure, multi-perspective data interpretation without schema lock-in."]

          [:h2 "Internal Economies and Resilience"]
          [:p "Both alignment and resilience emerge from the same substrate: the immutable stream."]
          [:p "The additive collaboration model of Datom.world reduces opportunism by making interactions traceable. Firms can create internal economies using ShiBi-like tokens to align agents' interests with collective goals, mitigating the classic principal-agent conflict."]
          [:p "The same infrastructure provides fault tolerance. The migratory nature of " [:a {:href "/yin.chp"} "yin.vm"] " computations means these structures are highly resilient. In an uncertain environment (a key driver for centralization in Williamson's Transaction Cost Economics), decentralized swarms adapt faster than rigid hierarchies. Code and state migrate across nodes without loss, allowing the \"firm\" to survive supply chain failures or infrastructure disruptions."]

          [:h2 "From Jobs to Streams"]
          [:p "What does this mean for the individual?"]
          [:p "Humans won't be employees; they will be owners of their own agent configurations. Your personal agents (stateless processes reading and writing streams on your behalf) will monitor streams for work they can perform or sub-contract, negotiating and executing autonomously. Your income becomes a stream of utility transfers from thousands of sources, rather than a regular paycheck from one."]
          [:p "But ownership means choice, not abdication. You decide what to delegate and what to do yourself. Some will automate aggressively; others will keep their hands in the work they find meaningful. The system enables both. Agency is preserved, not as a constraint, but as a feature."]
          [:p "The human economic experience shifts from 'having a job' to 'managing streams.'"]

          [:h2 "The Governance of Fluids"]
          [:p "Managing these fluid structures requires a new kind of operating system. Traditional legal contracts are too slow. We need " [:strong "computational contracts"] " that live in the stream."]
          [:p "This is the role of " [:a {:href "/dao-flow.chp"} "DaoFlow"] ". It provides the grammar for these ephemeral collaborations, defining the rules of engagement, value distribution, and dispute resolution in code that agents can understand and enforce."]

          [:h2 "When Fluids Freeze: Failure Modes"]
          [:p "No system is immune to adversarial behavior. What happens when agent swarms collude, when computational contracts contain ambiguous clauses, or when bad actors exploit the speed of automated negotiation?"]
          [:p "The answer lies in the same primitives that enable the system. Because all interactions are recorded as immutable datoms in " [:a {:href "/dao-db.chp"} "DaoDB"] ", forensic analysis becomes trivial. Reputation streams accumulate over time, making sustained bad behavior economically irrational. And for truly novel disputes (situations no code anticipated), humans remain the final arbiters, informed by complete, verifiable transaction histories."]
          [:p "The goal is not to eliminate all friction, but to make the cost of misbehavior exceed its rewards."]

          [:h2 "Conclusion: The Great Unbundling"]
          [:p "The Firm was a necessary bundle for the 20th century. The 21st century is about unbundling."]
          [:p "Traditional firms reliant on central control may face disruption as users defect to sovereign ecosystems. Small firms or startups could benefit most, forming adaptive swarms that outcompete hierarchies. Adoption barriers exist, but the trend is clear."]
          [:p "The deeper shift is conceptual. We have always coordinated through information: prices, contracts, reputations, commands. The Firm was a workaround for expensive information channels. When the channel becomes cheap and universal, the workaround becomes unnecessary."]
          [:p "Datom.world pushes toward decentralized, emergent structures. They are potentially more efficient and innovative, but less controllable. It redefines the firm not as a fortress, but as a stigmergic trace in a global, living information network."]
