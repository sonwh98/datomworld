           "Any proposal to tokenize attention as a solution for spam must contend with four fundamental counter-arguments. These arguments, drawn from social psychology, moral philosophy, and cognitive science, are not merely technical; they challenge the very idea that human interaction should be governed by market principles."]

          [:h2 "Critique 1: The Crowding Out Effect"]

          [:p
           "Philosopher Michael Sandel argues that markets are not neutral tools—they change the nature of the good being exchanged. "
           "When a price is put on a social interaction, it destroys the moral norms that previously governed it. For a recent philosophical discussion of these issues, see Katharine Browne and Sebastian Watzl's paper, "

           "."]

          [:p
           "The classic example comes from Gneezy and Rustichini's study of Israeli daycares. "
           "When daycares introduced fines for parents arriving late, lateness actually increased. "
           "Before the fine, parents were on time because they felt guilty about burdening teachers (social norm). "
           "After the fine, lateness became a service they could buy. "
           "The moral burden was lifted: \"I paid for this extra time, so I don't need to hurry.\""]

          [:p
           "Applied to attention markets: if a stranger pays to contact someone, they may feel entitled to that person's attention. "
           "\"I bought your token, why aren't you listening?\" "
           "Politeness (social friction) is replaced with transaction (market friction), potentially creating more aggressive, entitled spam rather than less."]

          [:h3 "Shibi's Answer: Fine vs. Wage"]

          [:p
           "The daycare study is often cited as a failure of markets, but a market economist would say the daycare simply mispriced the asset. "
           "They set a fixed, low fine, which was treated as a price for a service. Shibi reframes the interaction not as a fine (a punishment) but as a wage (a payment for labor). "
           "A person's attention has a price, and if someone pays that price, the transaction is an accepted contract for compensated attention."]

          [:p
           "Shibi works on a simple assumption: people will tolerate or even welcome spam if they are appropriately compensated. "
           "The question isn't whether spam should exist, it's who bears the cost. "
           "Traditional systems make receivers pay (in time and attention) while senders pay nothing. "
           "Shibi inverts this: if the rich want to reach someone, they transfer wealth to that person."]

          [:p
           "This transforms spam filtering into a wealth redistribution mechanism. "
           "Instead of platforms taking 100% of advertising revenue, advertisers pay users directly. "
           "If the price is right, it's no longer spam—it becomes compensated attention labor."]

          [:h2 "Critique 2: Cognitive Friction and Mental Accounting"]

          [:p
           "The human brain hates making micro-decisions. "
           "The cognitive cost of deciding \"Is this message worth $0.05?\" is often higher than the value of the message itself. "
           "This is why subscription models beat pay-per-view: we prefer flat fees to constant mental accounting."]

          [:p
           "The automated agent paradox: if agents automatically accept payments, the user is back to spam. "
           "If agents ask the user to approve each message, the user is back to cognitive fatigue."]

          [:p
           "The serendipity tax compounds this problem. "
           "High-value connections often start as low-value signals. "
           "A random \"hello\" from a stranger could be a future collaborator. "
           "If someone charges $5 for a \"hello,\" they filter out spam but also serendipity, isolating themselves in a walled garden of people they already know."]

          [:h3 "Shibi's Answer: Algorithmic Pricing"]

          [:p
           "Users can increase the cost of their attention to throttle spam or eliminate it entirely by setting unreasonably high prices. "
           "But manually adjusting prices would indeed create cognitive fatigue."]

          [:p
           "The solution: automated agents (Shibimon) shift from being spam filters (content analysis) to market makers (price analysis). "
           "They function like PID controllers, maintaining a target volume of messages:"]

          [:ul
           [:li "Target: User wants ~5 unsolicited messages per day"]
           [:li "Reality: 50 messages arrive in one hour"]
           [:li "Action: Agent automatically raises price to $50/token"]
           [:li "Result: Volume drops instantly"]
           [:li "Relaxation: If no messages come for days, agent lowers price to encourage connection"]]

          [:p
           "This removes cognitive burden. "
           "Users don't approve messages or set prices. "
           "They set a volume preference (\"I'm busy, silence mode\"), and the agent finds the market-clearing price to achieve it."]

          [:p
           "Spam is highly price-elastic. "
           "It relies on the \"spray and pray\" model: send 1,000,000 messages at zero cost, get 10 victims, profit. "
           "As soon as cost per message rises above zero, the spammer's ROI collapses. "
           "One does not need unreasonably high prices to stop 99% of botnets—just non-zero prices."]

          [:h2 "Critique 3: The Velvet Rope and Class Warfare"]

          [:p
           "Even with user-issued tokens, markets inherently favor the wealthy. "
           "A pay-to-speak model creates a two-tier society:"]

          [:ul
           [:li "The rich can afford to buy access to anyone. To a millionaire, a $50 token to pitch a scam is meaningless pocket change."]
           [:li "The poor cannot afford to message a potential employer, mentor, or doctor."]]

          [:p
           "The result: a recreation of the feudalism the internet was supposed to destroy. "
           "Access to influential people becomes a luxury good. "
           "The commons becomes a country club."]

          [:h3 "Shibi's Answer: Polycentric Token Issuance"]

          [:p
           "This critique assumes a single universal currency. "
           "Shibi isn't one coin—it's a factory for infinite, user-issued tokens. "
           "This distinction destroys the economies of scale that make spam profitable."]

          [:p
           "Standard spam works because it's \"Write Once, Blast Everywhere.\" "
           "In a single-token system, a rich attacker buys 1,000,000 tokens on an exchange and spams 1,000,000 people because everyone accepts the same coin. "
           "The rich attacker wins."]

          [:p
           "In Shibi's polycentric system:"]

          [:ul
           [:li "User A requires User A's token"]
           [:li "User B requires User B's token"]
           [:li "User C requires User C's token"]]

          [:p
           "The attacker cannot just \"buy the market.\" "
           "They must acquire millions of distinct currencies from millions of distinct issuers. "
           "The computational and logistical cost of managing 1,000,000 different wallets and negotiations kills the spammer—not just the token price."]

          [:p
           [:strong "Sovereignty matters"] ": Since a user issues their own token, they control the supply. "
           "If a rich spammer buys a user's token and annoys them, the user can blackhole that specific token batch or stop issuing to them. "
           "Their money is worthless if the user refuses to recognize it."]

          [:p
           [:strong "Localized pricing matters"] ": A user sets the price of their attention based on their context. "
           "A busy CEO might charge $100/token to deter cold calls. "
           "A student might give tokens away for free to make friends. "
           "Rules fit local conditions, not a global average."]

          [:p
           "By fragmenting the attention economy into millions of personal economies, the rich spammer cannot bypass the filter. "
           "Money cannot buy what a user refuses to issue."]

          [:h2 "Critique 4: Commodification of Friendship"]

          [:p
           "This is the most subtle but perhaps deepest critique. "
           "Tokenizing attention forces one to view friends and peers as customers or vendors."]

          [:p
           "The shift: instead of \"I want to share this with my friend because they'll like it,\" the mental model becomes \"I need to spend a token to send this.\" "
           "Even if friends are whitelisted, the architecture of the relationship is now defined by an economic whitelist, not organic social fluidity. "
           "It formalizes relationships that thrive on informality."]

          [:h3 "Shibi's Answer: The Dual Economy Model"]

          [:p
           "Communities can form and issue free tokens to their members. "
           "This creates two distinct modes of interaction:"]

          [:ul
           [:li [:strong "Internal (The Commons)"] ": Inside the community, tokens are gifted or whitelisted. Communication is free. This preserves social norms—friendship, reciprocity, serendipity."]
           [:li [:strong "External (The Market)"] ": Outside the community, tokens must be bought. Communication creates revenue. This uses market norms—price discovery, spam filtering."]]

          [:p
           "People don't charge their friends. They give them a key (free Shibi). "
           "The stranger is charged. The stranger pays to become a potential friend or customer."]

          [:p
           "This mirrors how human trust has worked for millennia: reciprocity for the tribe, trade for the stranger. "
           "The \"commodification\" critique assumes markets must govern all relationships. "
           "Shibi keeps the market at the border, preserving the gift economy within."]

          [:p
           "Free Shibi tokens become badges of membership, proving one is \"in the tribe\" and exempt from the market forces that govern the world outside. "
           "This satisfies Ostrom's Principle 1 (Clearly Defined Boundaries) in a socially programmable way. "
           "The boundary isn't purely financial (who has coins?)—it's social (who was invited?)."]

          [:h2 "The Remaining Challenge: UX Friction"]

          [:p
           "The theoretical model is sound. The remaining risk is purely user experience."]

          [:p
           "For the community exemption to work, giving someone free access must be easier than ignoring them. "
           "If a user meets a new friend, they need to \"hand them a digital key\" (airdrop a token, add to whitelist) in one tap. "
           "If the process of gifting free Shibi is tedious—copying wallet addresses, signing transactions—users will be lazy. "
           "They won't issue the free tokens, the social layer will fail, and the system will default to a cold, lonely market."]

          [:p
           "The polycentric architecture solves the economic and governance problems. "
           "Success depends entirely on making the gift mechanic invisible and seamless. Assuming this is achieved, the pricing model implies the emergence of distinct user behaviors."]

          [:h2 "Attention Profiles Emerge"]

          [:p

          [:ul

           [:li [:strong "The Consultant"] " (Price: $200): \"My inbox is my work queue. Pay me and I'll read it.\" Attention as labor."]
           [:li [:strong "The Socialite"] " (Price: $0.05): \"I'm looking for friends and opportunities. I filter only the cheapest bots.\" Maximizes serendipity."]]

          [:p
           "By shifting the variable from \"Is this spam?\" (a subjective, difficult AI problem) to \"Can they pay?\" (an objective, hard economic constraint), the problem space simplifies dramatically."]

          [:p

           [:li [:strong "Commodification of Friendship?"] " Solved by the dual economy model. Communities gift free tokens internally while maintaining market boundaries externally."]]

          [:p
           "The system is logically consistent. "
           "What remains is an engineering challenge: making the gift mechanic seamless enough that the social layer thrives alongside the market layer. "
