          [:h3 "1. The Logic Layer: Yin.VM as the Verifiable \"Gatekeeper\""]

          [:p
           "The first challenge in decentralized FL is running the \"filtering\" stage without a trusted server. "
           "If I ask a malicious node, \"Are you lying?\", it will obviously say \"No.\""]

          [:p
           "Instead of blindly accepting a model update, the network can require the contributor to run "
           "the update process inside a Yin.VM instance alongside a deterministic \"challenge\" task. "
