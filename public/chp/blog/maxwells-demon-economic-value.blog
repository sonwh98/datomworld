          [:p
           "The demon observes individual gas molecules approaching the door. When it sees a fast-moving molecule coming from the left, it opens the door to let it through to the right chamber. When it sees a slow-moving molecule coming from the right, it opens the door to let it through to the left chamber. For all other cases, it keeps the door closed."]
          [:p
           "Over time, this sorting process would concentrate fast (hot) molecules in one chamber and slow (cold) molecules in the other, creating a temperature difference from an initially uniform state. This temperature gradient could then be used to do work, like running a heat engine."]
          [:p
           [:strong "The paradox:"]
           " The demon appears to violate the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy (disorder) in a closed system can only increase or stay the same; it cannot spontaneously decrease. Yet the demon seems to decrease entropy just by observing and sorting particles."]
          [:p
           "The resolution came over a century later: The demon must record information about each particle it observes. This information is physical and occupies memory. When the demon erases or updates this memory to make room for new observations, it generates heat and increases entropy elsewhere in the system. The total entropy still increases, preserving the second law."]

           "The profound insight: "
           [:strong "Information is physical"]
           ". Acquiring, storing, and erasing information has thermodynamic cost. This principle, formalized as Landauer's principle, shows that computation itself is bound by the laws of thermodynamics."]
