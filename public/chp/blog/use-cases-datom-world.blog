Trust emerges stigmergically from queryable data trails, not central authority judgment."]

          [:h4 "The Problem"]
          [:p "POS systems and marketing platforms are siloed. Purchase data lives in one system, customer engagement in another. This disconnect makes personalized marketing guesswork and purchase verification (for reviews, warranties, returns) requires manual reconciliation."]
