All seven dispositions are present in `docs/design/dao.jing.cbor.md` at the stated places and each is complete: the get-half effect envelope (:79-84), the ClojureDart `list` producer obligation kept open (:143-147), the numeric consumer boundary naming `dao.space.index/compare-vals` with no string fallback, structural recursion, the comparison/arithmetic builtin split, and the index-collapse consequence (:213-232), the retired-versus-open item list including the intake transport limitation (:368-380), the Dart codec provenance (:387-389), step 3 and step 5 ownership including `dao.data.btree.storage` and §5.2 (:393-404), and the added scenarios (:432-441).

On the P2 decision: routing the comparison builtins through the portable operations while arithmetic stays host-native and rejects carriers loudly introduces no new architectural problem. It keeps one consistent equality/ordering contract across unification, index ordering, and predicates, and it confines the cross-host divergence to arithmetic over decoded floats, decimals, and rationals on Node and Dart, where the failure is loud and the limitation is recorded as intended alongside VM arithmetic staying outside the migration. The JVM computes those queries natively and Node/Dart refuse them, which is a documented host gap, not silent divergence.

Remaining defect: none.

Verdict: **APPROVE**. Every correction landed without changing the byte contract or any decision of record, and the plan now names each consumer boundary it touches.
