# src/jolt

The jolt host source root (docs/design/yin.repl-jolt-implementation.md §4.1-4.2).
The `:jolt` alias in `deps.edn` puts it before `src/cljc`, so a namespace here
overrides the portable one on jolt only.

Only complete, narrow host implementations live here, as `.jolt` files with the
same public surface and contract tests as the portable namespace they replace.
Small representation differences go in `#?(:jolt ...)` branches of the shared
`.cljc` source instead (`:cljd` first, then `:jolt`, then `:clj`/`:default`).
Never a copy of `yin.repl`, `yin.vm.engine` or `dao.jing.cbor`.

Empty at J0a round 1: the baseline closure (`yang.antlr.export`,
`yang.antlr.packet`) needs no host override.
